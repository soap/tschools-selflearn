## About tSchools
tSchools-SL is based on Laravel as a backend, Vue as frontend with power of InertiaJS. We use tailwind CSS.

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects.

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
